MQTTl
=====

Embedable MQTT protocol handler for Erlang applications.

This is meant to be a library you get as a dependency for your app and you
provide the callbacks to do whatever you need your app to do.

Some kind of webmachine for MQTT.

We provide a "reference" implementation so you can see how it's used and
play with it, maybe it even becomes a simple MQTT Server.
